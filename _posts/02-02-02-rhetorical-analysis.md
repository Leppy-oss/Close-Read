## Rhetorical Analysis

*Who Shot Mr. Burns?* employs a plethora of rhetorical strategies (**bolded**).<br>

The scene's opening shot features a series of **close-ups**, **triumphant music**, and an intensifying **screen shake** to build anticipation for the opening of Springfield Elementary's first oil well. The crowd's **body language** imparts a sense of hope to the viewer: that these drops of oil have the potential to dramatically transform Springfield's commmunity.

</figure>

The ensuing **subversion of expectations** - a single, lackluster drop of oil - is thus incredibly disappointing, compelling the viewer to pity the school and creating the beginnings of a critique of the American Dream. Of course, Springfield Elementary's failure to strike oil is made all the more wry by **dramatic irony**. Earlier scenes in the episode all but confirm that Mr. Burns, Springfield's greedy corporate mastermind, plans to steal the school's oil. So to an extent, and because it's *The Simpsons*, the viewer expects Springfield Elementary's drilling efforts to fail.

  <figcaption><i>In a buildup of dramatic irony, the viewer anticipates Mr. Burns to be the oil thief.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Its eventual occurrence further develops the idea that the school, which represents average Americans, was never in control of its future. Principal Skinner's promised prosperity, which **parallels** the prosperity promised by the American Dream, was destined to never come.

Following Mr. Burns's successful slant drilling operation, several moments of **absurdism** occur, including the total annihilation of Bart Simpson's treehouse.

</figure>

The massive destruction caused by Mr. Burns's drilling operations is clearly unrealistic (oil does not have a mind of its own), but it reinforces the overall message of the episode and the assertion of the close read; the destruction of the community's physical structures **symbolizes** the deeper societal effects of unchecked capitalism. It also involves a **shift** in the connotation and **imagery** of oil from black gold to destructive tar.

At this point, the imagery of oil and Mr. Burns themselves warrant a closer read. Mr. Burns is a masterclass in **caricaturing**; he embodies America's corporate tycoons, such as Standard Oil founder John D. Rockefeller.

</figure>

Rockefeller and other Gilded Age tycoons were commonly referred to as "robber barons" for their exploitative and unethical practices. Mr. Burns takes this  epithet to the next level by robbing literal children of their only ticket to a better future. The fact that Mr. Burns involves himself in oil drilling in *Who Shot Mr. Burns?* only strengthens his **allusion** to Rockefeller, which further emphasizes his role in the episode as a symbol of corporate greed. 

Returning to the plot, Principal Skinner informs a dismayed faculty that the school has "no legal recourse against Mr. Burns" because "the oil belongs to whoever pumped it first."

Whether or not this is legally true, Skinner's statement puts the corporate takeover of community resources on full display.

Integral to the American Dream is the idea that government non-intervention promotes individual prosperity. The **irony** in *Who Shot Mr. Burns?* (and in American society) is that that same non-intervention enables corporate exploitation and inequality, undermining the very prosperity it is trusted to uphold.

The **situational irony** is almost comedically expanded as Skinner reveals that the school will have to cut its most prized programs, including music and maintenance, to pay for its now-useless oil rig. The wealth surplus promised by the discovery of oil has now turned into a deficit, all to line the pockets of Mr. Burns. Just as Springfield Elementary failed to benefit from its newfound resources, the American Dream is suggested to be similarly futile, if not destructive.

The oil drilling scene from *Who Shot Mr. Burns?* concludes with Waylon Smithers, Mr. Burns's assistant, looking through a series of **panning shots**, which convey the destruction brought upon Springfield by Mr. Burns's greed. Yet when confronted by Smithers, Mr. Burns is apathetic to Springfield's suffering. He is so blinded by greed that he even has the audacity to remain unsatisfied.

With his final words on-screen, Mr. Burns delivers one last rebuff to the American Dream. He has sunk Springfield's aspirations, ensuring that whatever hope its residents once held remains fleeting.
