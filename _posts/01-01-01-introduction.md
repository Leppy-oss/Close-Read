*Who Shot Mr. Burns?*, *The Simpsons*'s 128th episode, was aired in two parts on Fox in 1995. Part 1 sets up the mystery surrounding the shooting of <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Charles_Montgomery_Burns" target="_blank">Mr. Burns</a>, Springfield’s wealthiest resident, and ends on a dramatic cliffhanger. Part 2, released four months later, reveals the perpetrator. This close read focuses on the first episode as a prime example of how *The Simpsons* engages with the American Dream.

## Historical Context: The 1990s

In July 1990, America plunged into a recession from which it would not fully emerge until 2001. Job security declined, wages stagnated, and public skepticism toward the American Dream reached all-time highs. At the same time, wealth inequality expanded; globalization, technological advancements, and widespread deregulation lined the pockets of corporations and the wealthy while leaving workers behind. Political and cultural shifts, such as the rise of neoconservatism and the popularization of the internet, further contributed to the uncertainty that pervaded the leadup to the year 2000.

Against this backdrop, the 1990s saw The Simpsons reach the peak of its popularity. Millions of viewers related to the show’s sharp satirization of America, seen through the lens of the fictional town of Springfield.

## Matt Groening’s Exigence: The Spark for the Episode

Matt Groening, creator of *The Simpsons*, conceived the idea for a Twin Peaks-style Simpsons episode as both a comical homage to mystery tropes and a satirical critique of corporate greed. Groening has always viewed *The Simpsons* as his magnum opus - not for its artistic sophistication but for its meditation on the American Dream. 

> "We are proud to be a part of a tradition of television that includes shows like *All in the Family*, *M\*A\*S\*H*, and *The Mary Tyler Moore Show*, which have used the medium to reflect and satirize American life."

Springfield, a microcosm of American suburbia, is the perfect setting for *Who Shot Mr. Burns?*, an episode that exemplifies Groening’s purpose at its finest: exposing the hypocrisy and flaws in American society.

## The Fundamental Assertion

"Who Shot Mr. Burns? – Part One" uses satire and absurdity to demonstrate that while the American Dream promises prosperity through hard work and honesty, that prosperity is concentrated in the hands of those who manipulate the system. Ultimately, the ideals of merit and equality baked into the American Dream are undermined by the very institutions responsible for upholding them.
