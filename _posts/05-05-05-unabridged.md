*Who Shot Mr. Burns?*, *The Simpsons*'s 128th episode, was aired in two parts on Fox in 1995. Part 1 sets up the mystery surrounding the shooting of <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Charles_Montgomery_Burns" target="_blank">Mr. Burns</a>, Springfield’s wealthiest resident, and ends on a dramatic cliffhanger. Part 2, released four months later, reveals the perpetrator. This close read focuses on the first episode as a prime example of how *The Simpsons* engages with the American Dream.

## Historical Context: The 1990s

In July 1990, America plunged into a recession from which it would not fully emerge until 2001. Job security declined, wages stagnated, and public skepticism toward the American Dream reached all-time highs. At the same time, wealth inequality expanded; globalization, technological advancements, and widespread deregulation lined the pockets of corporations and the wealthy while leaving workers behind. Political and cultural shifts, such as the rise of neoconservatism and the popularization of the internet, further contributed to the uncertainty that pervaded the leadup to the year 2000.

Against this backdrop, the 1990s saw The Simpsons reach the peak of its popularity. Millions of viewers related to the show’s sharp satirization of America, seen through the lens of the fictional town of Springfield.

## Matt Groening’s Exigence: The Spark for the Episode

</figure>

Matt Groening, creator of *The Simpsons*, conceived the idea for a Twin Peaks-style Simpsons episode as both a comical homage to mystery tropes and a satirical critique of corporate greed. Groening has always viewed *The Simpsons* as his magnum opus - not for its artistic sophistication but for its meditation on the American Dream. 

> "We are proud to be a part of a tradition of television that includes shows like *All in the Family*, *M\*A\*S\*H*, and *The Mary Tyler Moore Show*, which have used the medium to reflect and satirize American life."
> <div style="text-align: right; font-size: large; color: gray; margin-top: 1rem;">— <a href="https://peabodyawards.com/award-profile/the-simpsons/" target="_blank"><cite>Matt Groening</cite></a></div>

Springfield, a microcosm of American suburbia, is the perfect setting for *Who Shot Mr. Burns?*, an episode that exemplifies Groening’s purpose at its finest: exposing the hypocrisy and flaws in American society.

## The Fundamental Assertion

"Who Shot Mr. Burns? – Part One" uses satire and absurdity to demonstrate that while the American Dream promises prosperity through hard work and honesty, that prosperity is concentrated in the hands of those who manipulate the system. Ultimately, the ideals of merit and equality baked into the American Dream are undermined by the very institutions responsible for upholding them.

# Rhetorical Analysis

*Who Shot Mr. Burns?* employs a plethora of rhetorical strategies (**bolded**).<br>

The scene's opening shot features a series of **close-ups**, **triumphant music**, and an intensifying **screen shake** to build anticipation for the opening of Springfield Elementary's first oil well. The crowd's **body language** imparts a sense of hope to the viewer: that these drops of oil have the potential to dramatically transform Springfield's commmunity.

<figure style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px">
  <img src="{{ '/assets/img/oil-drop.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Oil drop"/>
  <figcaption><i>A lackluster drop of oil spouts from the Springfield Elementary oil well.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

The ensuing **subversion of expectations** - a single, lackluster drop of oil - is thus incredibly disappointing, compelling the viewer to pity the school and creating the beginnings of a critique of the American Dream. Of course, Springfield Elementary's failure to strike oil is made all the more wry by **dramatic irony**. Earlier scenes in the episode all but confirm that Mr. Burns, Springfield's greedy corporate mastermind, plans to steal the school's oil. So to an extent, and because it's *The Simpsons*, the viewer expects Springfield Elementary's drilling efforts to fail.

<figure style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px">
  <img src="{{ '/assets/img/burns-rig.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Mr. Burns drills"/>
  <figcaption><i>In a buildup of dramatic irony, the viewer anticipates Mr. Burns to be the oil thief.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Its eventual occurrence further develops the idea that the school, which represents average Americans, was never in control of its future. Principal Skinner's promised prosperity, which **parallels** the prosperity promised by the American Dream, was destined to never come.

Following Mr. Burns's successful slant drilling operation, several moments of **absurdism** occur, including the total annihilation of Bart Simpson's treehouse.

<figure style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px">
  <img src="{{ '/assets/img/absurdist-montage.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Absurdist montage"/>
  <figcaption><i>From left to right: Bart's treehouse is annihilated, Moe's tavern is flooded with toxic fumes, and the Springfield Retirement Castle is torn in half.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

The massive destruction caused by Mr. Burns's drilling operations is clearly unrealistic (oil does not have a mind of its own), but it reinforces the overall message of the episode and the assertion of the close read; the destruction of the community's physical structures **symbolizes** the deeper societal effects of unchecked capitalism. It also involves a **shift** in the connotation and **imagery** of oil from black gold to destructive tar.

At this point, the imagery of oil and Mr. Burns themselves warrant a closer read. Mr. Burns is a masterclass in **caricaturing**; he embodies America's corporate tycoons, such as Standard Oil founder John D. Rockefeller.

<figure style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px">
  <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/digitalspyuk.cdnds.net/16/40/1475575323-burns-real-life.jpg" alt="Mr. Burns & Rockefeller"/>
  <figcaption><i>Mr. Burns is confirmed to be a caricature of John D. Rockefeller (right) and Fox founder Barry Diller (left).</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Rockefeller and other Gilded Age tycoons were commonly referred to as "robber barons" for their exploitative and unethical practices. Mr. Burns takes this  epithet to the next level by robbing literal children of their only ticket to a better future. The fact that Mr. Burns involves himself in oil drilling in *Who Shot Mr. Burns?* only strengthens his **allusion** to Rockefeller, which further emphasizes his role in the episode as a symbol of corporate greed. 

Returning to the plot, Principal Skinner informs a dismayed faculty that the school has "no legal recourse against Mr. Burns" because "the oil belongs to whoever pumped it first."

Whether or not this is legally true, Skinner's statement puts the corporate takeover of community resources on full display.

<figure style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px">

  <figcaption><i>Skinner's meeting with faculty exemplifies all that is wrong with capitalist America.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Integral to the American Dream is the idea that government non-intervention promotes individual prosperity. The **irony** in *Who Shot Mr. Burns?* (and in American society) is that that same non-intervention enables corporate exploitation and inequality, undermining the very prosperity it is trusted to uphold.

The **situational irony** is almost comedically expanded as Skinner reveals that the school will have to cut its most prized programs, including music and maintenance, to pay for its now-useless oil rig. The wealth surplus promised by the discovery of oil has now turned into a deficit, all to line the pockets of Mr. Burns. Just as Springfield Elementary failed to benefit from its newfound resources, the American Dream is suggested to be similarly futile, if not destructive.

The oil drilling scene from *Who Shot Mr. Burns?* concludes with Waylon Smithers, Mr. Burns's assistant, looking through a series of **panning shots**, which convey the destruction brought upon Springfield by Mr. Burns's greed. Yet when confronted by Smithers, Mr. Burns is apathetic to Springfield's suffering. He is so blinded by greed that he even has the audacity to remain unsatisfied.

  <img src="{{ '/assets/img/smithers.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Smithers confronts Mr. Burns"/>
  <figcaption><i>Smithers confronts an impassive Mr. Burns.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

With his final words on-screen, Mr. Burns delivers one last rebuff to the American Dream. He has sunk Springfield's aspirations, ensuring that whatever hope its residents once held remains fleeting.

# Connection to Upton Sinclair's *The Jungle*

*The Jungle* reveals shockingly similar perspectives to *Who Shot Mr. Burns?* in its polemical critique of unchecked capitalism and the futility of the American Dream.

The hardships of Springfield’s residents in *The Simpsons* parallel those of new immigrants in *The Jungle*; both groups find themselves at the mercy of a ruthless system that prioritizes the interests of the wealthy elite (Mr. Burns in *The Simpsons*, Boss Connor in *The Jungle*). 

<figure style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px">
  <img src="{{ '/assets/img/capitalism.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Capitalism graphic" style="margin-top: -30px;"/>
  <figcaption style="margin-top: -20px;">Both <i>The Simpsons</i> (left) and <i>The Jungle</i> (right) criticize capitalism and its blow to the American Dream.</figcaption>
</figure>

The protagonists of both works - common, working-class citizens - feel disillusioned with their lack of agency over their own lives. In *The Jungle*, Jurgis Rudkus realizes (following the death of his wife and children) that his hopes of building a better life in America have been crushed by exploitation and despair; his life is literally drained as he loses his family and humanity. Similarly, in *Who Shot Mr. Burns?*, Springfield’s residents watch in horror as Mr. Burns’s unrivalled power and greed upends their sole hope for a better education; their lives are metaphorically drained as Mr. Burns pilfers their oil.

> "If we are the greatest nation the sun ever shone upon, it would seem to be mainly because we have been able to goad our wage-earners to this pitch of frenzy."

Examining these quotes, it is clear that in both *Who Shot Mr. Burns* and *The Jungle*, laissez-faire capitalism enables the defeat of the working class, rebuking the American Dream and reaffirming the assertion that the prosperity it promises only applies to those in power.

# Conclusion

Nearly two-hundred and fifty years after its inception, the American Dream now seems closer to collapse than ever before; for it to continue standing, it must be understood in all of its nuances and falsities. There is perhaps no better a medium to do so than America's most beloved TV show, *The Simpsons*.

*Who Shot Mr. Burns?* offers an insightful critique of the American Dream. By utilizing Mr. Burns as a caricature of corporate greed and oil as an allusion to America's Gilded Age capitalism, Springfield becomes a microcosm of America. And with all of the same systemic flaws, it is quickly demonstrated that just as Springfield's promised oil was stolen from those who deserved it, the prosperity promised by the American Dream is concentrated in the hands of those who manipulate the system.

If the American Dream is only attainable for the elite, was it ever real to begin with? And if it was, is it still worth saving? If there's one thing we can learn from *Who Shot Mr. Burns?*, it's that prosperity is only meaningful when accessible to all. In all other forms, it is merely a disguise for exploitation and inequality.
