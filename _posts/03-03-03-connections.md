*The Jungle* reveals shockingly similar perspectives to *Who Shot Mr. Burns?* in its polemical critique of unchecked capitalism and the futility of the American Dream.

The hardships of Springfield’s residents in *The Simpsons* parallel those of new immigrants in *The Jungle*; both groups find themselves at the mercy of a ruthless system that prioritizes the interests of the wealthy elite (Mr. Burns in *The Simpsons*, Boss Connor in *The Jungle*).

The protagonists of both works - common, working-class citizens - feel disillusioned with their lack of agency over their own lives. In *The Jungle*, Jurgis Rudkus realizes (following the death of his wife and children) that his hopes of building a better life in America have been crushed by exploitation and despair; his life is literally drained as he loses his family and humanity. Similarly, in *Who Shot Mr. Burns?*, Springfield’s residents watch in horror as Mr. Burns’s unrivalled power and greed upends their sole hope for a better education; their lives are metaphorically drained as Mr. Burns pilfers their oil.

Examining these quotes, it is clear that in both *Who Shot Mr. Burns* and *The Jungle*, laissez-faire capitalism enables the defeat of the working class, rebuking the American Dream and reaffirming the assertion that the prosperity it promises only applies to those in power.
