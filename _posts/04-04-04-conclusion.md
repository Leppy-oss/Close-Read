Nearly two-hundred and fifty years after its inception, the American Dream now seems closer to collapse than ever before; for it to continue standing, it must be understood in all of its nuances and falsities. There is perhaps no better a medium to do so than America's most beloved TV show, *The Simpsons*.

*Who Shot Mr. Burns?* offers an insightful critique of the American Dream. By utilizing Mr. Burns as a caricature of corporate greed and oil as an allusion to America's Gilded Age capitalism, Springfield becomes a microcosm of America. And with all of the same systemic flaws, it is quickly demonstrated that just as Springfield's promised oil was stolen from those who deserved it, the prosperity promised by the American Dream is concentrated in the hands of those who manipulate the system.

If the American Dream is only attainable for the elite, was it ever real to begin with? And if it was, is it still worth saving? If there's one thing we can learn from *Who Shot Mr. Burns?*, it's that prosperity is only meaningful when accessible to all. In all other forms, it is merely a disguise for exploitation and inequality.
